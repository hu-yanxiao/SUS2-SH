| Case | Mean Loop Time | Relative To Main |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| main old gate | `14.760067 s` | `1.0000x` |
| mu-body linear-combo | `16.754067 s` | `1.1351x` |
| mu-scalar full | `17.457800 s` | `1.1828x` |

Both active mu gate modes are within the target `1.2x` main-branch LAMMPS
speed envelope on this benchmark. The exact optimizations promoted in the
final binary are:

- mode-specific gate-force cache strategy: body-linear-combo uses cached basic
  Jacobians; mu-scalar-full caches radial values/derivatives and recomputes the
  compact SH Jacobian on demand;
- grouped \(\mu\)-major SH Jacobian contraction for the on-demand full mode;
- direct stride-4 body-linear-combo gate-signal and adjoint contractions;
- branchless full-mode on-demand contraction over grouped SH basic terms;
- single-gate no-center main-layer force/adjoint path, leaving the double-gate
  center path separate.

The stage timings are reduced by MPI max per stage, so the component means do
not need to sum exactly to the total. The actionable signal is that full mode
still spends more in gate-force adjoint work, while communication is already a
large fraction of the 40-rank short-run profile.

```

This candidate precomputed \(\partial h_{i,s}/\partial r_{ij}\) for every gate
signal \(s\) and edge, reducing the late gate-force cache from
`alpha_index_basic_count` entries per edge to `gate_signal_stride` entries per
edge. The math is exact after explicitly handling product-graph square terms
where `a0 == a1`, but the extra multi-RHS scalar-product reverse pass dominates
the saved memory traffic on the tested model. Do not promote this candidate.

Double-site implementation commit hash:

## Formula

The gate first forms one shared scalar per body order:

\[
H_{a,B}
=
\sum_{q:\operatorname{body\_order}(s_q)=B}
c_q s_q(a),
\qquad
B=2,\ldots,k_{\max}+1 .
\]

Each \(\mu\) channel then mixes those body-order scalars with its own
coefficients:

\[
h_{a,\mu}
=
\sum_{B=2}^{k_{\max}+1}
W_{\mu B}H_{a,B}.
\]

Equivalently,

\[
h_{a,\mu}
=
\sum_{B=2}^{k_{\max}+1}
W_{\mu B}
\sum_{q:\operatorname{body\_order}(s_q)=B}
c_q s_q(a).
\]

The additive tanh coefficient is species-only:

\[
a_{z,\mu}=a_z .
\]

The default neighbor-site SH moment is:

\[
M_{i,\mu m}
=
\sum_{j\in N(i)} t_{z_i}t_{z_j}
\left[1+A\tanh(a_{z_j}h_{j,\mu})\right]
R_{\mu}(r_{ij})Y_{lm}(\hat r_{ij})
\]

The optional double-site gate first defines

\[
g_{a,\mu}=1+A\tanh(a_{z_a}h_{a,\mu})
\]

and then evaluates

\[
M_{i,\mu m}
=
\sum_{j\in N(i)} t_{z_i}t_{z_j}
g_{i,\mu}g_{j,\mu}
R_{\mu}(r_{ij})Y_{lm}(\hat r_{ij})
\]

Default initialization is:

\[
c_q^{(0)}=0,\qquad W_{\mu B}^{(0)}=1,\qquad a_z^{(0)}=1.
\]

Thus \(h_{a,\mu}^{(0)}=0\), the initial gate factor is exactly 1, and the
model starts from ordinary SUS2-SH while \(c_q\) still has a nonzero first-step
gradient.

## CLI And Model Rules

- `--two-layer-gate-body-order` is not a normal option for this branch. Passing
  it explicitly is an error.
- `--two-layer-gate` requires:

  \[
  \texttt{body-order} \ge \texttt{k-max}+1
  \]

- `two_layer_gate_scalar_indices` automatically contains scalar basis functions
  with body orders `2..k_max+1`.
- `two_layer_gate_weights` is the shared \(c_q\) vector and has length equal to
  `two_layer_gate_scalar_indices`.
- `two_layer_gate_body_mix_weights` is the \(W_{\mu B}\) matrix flattened as
  `radial_func_count * k_max`.
- The branch does not save or use `two_layer_gate_bias` / \(G_0\). Zero gate
  weights give \(h_{j,\mu}=0\), hence \(1+A\tanh(0)=1\), so the model reduces to
  ordinary SUS2-SH.
- New gate models write:

  ```text
  two_layer_gate_mode = mu-body-linear-combo|mu-scalar-full
  two_layer_gate_site_mode = neighbor|double
  ```

  Legacy two-layer gate metadata is rejected instead of being silently read as
  the new mode.
- `--two-layer-residual` is not supported by this mu-body-order gate branch.

## Implementation Notes

- Gate caches are per atom times mu: \(h_{j,\mu}\), not one scalar per atom.
- The implementation caches \(s_q\), compresses them to the small \(H_B\) vector,
  and then applies the \(W_{\mu B}\) matrix. This keeps the core signal build at
  \(O(N_q+N_\mu k_{\max})\) per atom instead of \(O(N_\mu N_q)\).
- Gate adjoints are also per atom times mu. During reverse mode, adjoints first
  accumulate into body-order buckets and then into the shared \(c_q\) scalar
  weights and scalar-value chain.
- The optional `mu-scalar-full` mode keeps one independent gate coefficient per
  \((\mu,q)\) pair while reusing the same scalar basis values \(s_q\). Its
  forward signal, force-chain scalar seeds, directional derivative, and gate
  weight gradient are batched through BLAS matrix/vector products instead of
  nested \(\mu,q\) loops.
- The existing tanh cache, edge cache, site derivative cache, and shared-radial
  gate paths are preserved.
- CPU LAMMPS reads `two_layer_gate_mode` and `two_layer_gate_site_mode`,
  supports both `mu-body-linear-combo` and `mu-scalar-full`, communicates
  compact per-body-order gate signals/adjoints for `mu-body-linear-combo`,
  communicates per-mu signals/adjoints for exact `mu-scalar-full`, applies the
  same neighbor or double-site gate factor, and rejects legacy gate fields.
- CPU LAMMPS now propagates gate force-chain derivatives by caching first-layer
  basic moment Jacobians per active edge and doing one combined scalar-product
  reverse pass per center atom, avoiding the old edge-by-scalar derivative
  materialization.
- Kokkos device gate evaluation is explicitly rejected for this branch rather
  than silently using the old scalar-gate kernels.

Final build and smoke evidence on the server:

```text
BUILD_RC=0
SMOKE_RC=0
```

The accepted optimization keeps the exact-body mu math but merges per-body-order
gate adjoints once per atom instead of rerunning the scalar reverse path once
for every body-order bucket. This preserves the existing tanh cache, edge
primitive cache, site-derivative cache, and shared-radial paths.

Training-speed decision at matched profile settings:

| Version | Gradient total | Forward total | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| legacy scalar gate | `71.738 ms` | `61.323 ms` | old reference |
| accepted exact-body opt1 | `76.593 ms` | `62.535 ms` | synchronized |
| rejected final clear/cache candidate | `79.046 ms` | `62.561 ms` | rejected |

The final clear/cache candidate was stopped after collecting profile data
because it remained slower at `calls=570`. Its LSF job `3792234` therefore
ended with MPI interrupt text from the intentional stop, not from a correctness
failure.

## Double-Site Optimization Update 2026-06-12

The final double-site optimization keeps the existing exact-body gate math and
the existing neighbor-site fast paths. It adds a small center-gate scratch cache
for repeated `PrepareTwoLayerGatePairMuBuffers()` calls with the same center
atom and signal pointer, avoids computing `sech^2` when no derivative buffer is
requested, and avoids materializing the neighbor multiplier buffer unless the
caller asks for it. The LAMMPS CPU pair style also reuses per-pair mu adjoint
scratch arrays instead of allocating `std::vector<double>` inside the edge
adjoint loops.

```

Final matched profile:

| Mode | Runtime | Linear total | Gradient total | Forward total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| neighbor-site | `478 s` | `428.333 ms` | `90.000 ms` | `68.500 ms` |
| double-site | `485 s` | `423.258 ms` | `96.217 ms` | `69.497 ms` |

The double-site runtime overhead at the matched profile settings is therefore
`485 / 478 = 1.015x`. Before this update the same comparison was `501 / 478 =
1.048x`, so the measured double-site overhead dropped from about `4.8%` to
about `1.5%`.

## Full-Mode And LAMMPS Efficiency Update

The retained `mu-scalar-full` mode is no longer a legacy fallback. It uses the
same scalar basis cache as `mu-body-linear-combo`, but stores an independent
flattened weight matrix over \((\mu,q)\). The hot training paths use BLAS for
the full weight projection, scalar-seed projection, directional derivative,
outer-product gate-weight gradient, and scalar-parameter seed accumulation.

## LAMMPS Gate-Mode Efficiency Update 2026-06-15

The independent CPU LAMMPS branch binary was rebuilt from the current
`codex/mu-body-order-gate` source after optimizing the exact gate dataflow:

```

Implementation notes:

- `mu-body-linear-combo` stores and communicates only the body-channel signals
  \(H_b\) and body-channel adjoints. Each receiving rank reconstructs
  \(h_\mu=\sum_b c_{\mu b}H_b\) locally before the tanh gate. During reverse
  communication, each per-mu gate adjoint is contracted back to
  \(dE/dH_b=\sum_\mu c_{\mu b}\,dE/dh_\mu\). This is algebraically exact and
  reduces the l4k4 communication width from 20 doubles to 4 doubles per atom.
- `mu-scalar-full` remains exact and still communicates the 20 per-mu
  \(h_\mu\) values/adjoints. The scalar basis is shared, and a scalar-major
  transposed weight view is used for the full-mode gate-force reverse
  contraction.
- The first-layer edge derivative cache now reserves once and writes by offset
  instead of appending large derivative slices with repeated vector `insert()`.
- LAMMPS gate communication pack/unpack uses exact block copies for contiguous
  gate-signal buffers; reverse unpack still accumulates per entry because LAMMPS
  reverse communication returns contributions to owned atoms.

| `mu-scalar-full` | `6.796363 s` | `1.5663x` |

The first body-channel communication build on the same benchmark gave
`mu-body-linear-combo = 5.396523 s` (`1.2254x` against that run's main
baseline) and `mu-scalar-full = 6.999947 s` (`1.5894x`). The final build keeps
the full-mode scalar-major reverse optimization because it improves the full
absolute loop time, while the combo absolute time remains in the same range.

The remaining `mu-scalar-full` gap is dominated by exact per-mu forward and
reverse communication. With arbitrary independent \(w_{\mu q}\), communicating
20 per-mu \(h_\mu\) values/adjoints is the compact exact representation; the
alternative of communicating all scalar basis values would be much larger.
Approximate low-rank compression is intentionally not used. The tested B-model
full weight matrix is numerically close to low-rank, but not exactly low-rank:
rank-1 SVD reconstruction leaves about `1e-4` max absolute residual and rank-7
still leaves about `3e-10`. The body-mix matrix is also only numerically close
to rank-1, with about `1.7e-10` rank-1 residual. These are approximation
opportunities, not exact algorithmic reductions, and are therefore out of scope.

### No-Zero Gate-Value LAMMPS Update 2026-06-15

The current accepted CPU LAMMPS branch binary adds two exact dataflow
optimizations on top of the body-channel communication build:

- The first-layer gate moment cache is reused as a member buffer instead of
  reallocated every step, and the scalar scratch buffer is resized once.
- `mu-scalar-full` accumulates the full gate projection through a scalar-major
  transposed weight view so each scalar value is loaded once and the 20
  \(\mu\)-weights are contiguous.
- `two_layer_gate_values` is no longer pre-zeroed over all local and ghost atoms
  before the gate forward pass. Each local atom's gate signal is fully written by
  the first-layer pass, static fixed atoms are copied from their cache, and ghost
  signals are fully written by LAMMPS forward communication. The adjoint buffer
  is still zeroed because reverse communication accumulates into it.

The no-zero update gives a small exact improvement, but the same conclusion
holds: on this very small 384-atom/96-rank benchmark, the remaining full-mode
gap is communication dominated. `mu-body-linear-combo` must communicate 4
body-channel signals/adjoints for the l4k4 model; `mu-scalar-full` must
communicate 20 independent per-\(\mu\) signals/adjoints. The LAMMPS pack/unpack
path already sends contiguous signal blocks. Reducing the full-mode width below
20 would require an exact low-rank/sparse identity in the trained weight matrix
or a change in the mathematical model; no approximate compression is used.

### Raw Edge/Comm Direct LAMMPS Update 2026-06-15

The current accepted CPU LAMMPS branch binary adds exact data-layout and hot-loop
optimizations on top of the no-zero build:

- Gate edge staging uses LAMMPS-managed raw contiguous buffers instead of
  per-step `std::vector` clear/reserve/push/resize traffic.
- The common l4k4 `mu-body-linear-combo` path specializes the four body-channel
  signal and adjoint maps while keeping the same per-\(\mu\) accumulation order.
- Forward and reverse gate communication add fixed-width stride 4 and stride 20
  pack/unpack paths. The communicated values and adjoint sums are unchanged.

forward-pack specialization gave `mu-body-linear-combo = 5.313430 s`
(`1.1989x` relative to that job's main run) and `mu-scalar-full = 6.914083 s`.
Across the matched jobs, the accepted code gives a repeatable improvement over
the previous branch binary. The remaining `mu-scalar-full` gap is still
communication dominated because this mode exactly carries 20 independent
per-\(\mu\) gate signals and adjoints for the l4k4 model.

### Direct Derivative-Flow LAMMPS Update 2026-06-15

The current retained CPU LAMMPS branch source adds another exact memory-flow
cleanup on top of the raw-edge/comm-direct build:

- The first-layer gate SH pass writes the raw edge derivative planes directly
  into the gate derivative cache, instead of first writing the ordinary
  `moment_jacobian_{x,y,z}` slabs and then copying them.
- The first-layer gate moment buffer is cleared only through the gate scalar
  dependency width, not the full model moment width.
- The late gate-force scalar seed is accumulated directly into
  `nbh_energy_ders_wrt_moments`; the temporary scalar scratch vector is removed.

The retained no-IPO build is the best full-mode result in this matched job, and
IPO is neutral/slightly better only for combo. The direct derivative-flow
cleanup therefore remains useful but not sufficient to make either new gate
mode reach the old main gate speed on this small 40-rank B benchmark.

```

The benchmark models were also checked for exact structural compression
opportunities. The trained `mu-body-linear-combo` body-mix rows and
`mu-scalar-full` rows are numerically close to each other, but they are not
exactly duplicate rows. Therefore the communication width cannot be reduced
without changing the mathematical model or using approximation, which is out of
scope for this branch.

### Full-Matrix Optimization Policy 2026-06-16

LAMMPS optimization candidates are now evaluated as model-family backends, not
as single-case fixes. Each exact candidate must be benchmarked over the full
representative matrix before it is promoted:

```text
l/k: l2k2, l2k3, l3k3, l4k4
factor pruning: legacy, q_total
gate weight mode: mu-body-linear-combo, mu-scalar-full
LAMMPS model form: trained model converted to *_lmp read-table radial basis
LAMMPS cell: B-system first training structure, replicate 6 6 6
baseline: current SUS2-SH main/developer LAMMPS binary
branch binary: independent mu-body-order-gate LAMMPS binary
```

The goal remains a mathematically exact implementation. If one backend is
consistently best across the matrix, it becomes the default path. If different
model sizes or pruning modes favor different exact kernels, model loading should
dispatch by stable model metadata such as \(l_{\max}\), \(k_{\max}\),
`alpha_index_basic` size, gate mode, signal stride, and scalar count. A
candidate that only improves one corner case is retained only as a specialized
dispatch path when the full matrix shows that it does not regress the other
cases.

The current candidate-matrix harness records both raw loop times and
main-relative ratios for all cases, so backend selection can be based on the
observed matrix rather than on one l4k4 benchmark.

Each new LAMMPS optimization version must be treated as a candidate backend and
run over the whole matrix above before promotion. The decision record must keep:

- source commit or source file hashes for the candidate;
- binary path and SHA-256;
- full matrix output directory;
- median and mean ratio against the same-case main binary;
- worst-case ratio, number of cases above `1.20x`, and the best backend per
  case.

This avoids overfitting the implementation to one model size. If a candidate
improves only a subset such as large `l4k4` models or only
`mu-body-linear-combo`, it can be retained only behind a model-load dispatch
path whose predicate is based on stable model metadata. If no single exact
backend covers all representative cases, the dispatch table should be derived
from the full matrix and revalidated whenever the backend code changes.

| l4k4 | `mu-scalar-full` | `50.667400 s` | `60.127400 s` | `1.1867x` |

Decision: promote this product-array backend as the current exact LAMMPS
implementation for single-gate `q_total` models with \(l \le 4\), \(k \le 4\).
All measured representative cases are at or below the `1.20x` target. The
tightest case is `l3k3` `mu-scalar-full` at `1.1994x`, so future changes should
rerun this matrix before promotion.

Rejected exact candidates during this optimization round:

- `stride2` direct body-adjoint specialization preserved parity but slowed the
  l2k2 hot case (`1.2823x` vs main in
  `/work/phy-weigw/hyx/xxx-b/test/codex_stride2_l2k2_body_speed_40_20260617_061120`);
  it was reverted and is not present in the promoted source.
- `SUS2_LAMMPS_GATE_MU_INDEXED_BASIC=1` preserved the mathematical path but
  increased l2k2 `mu-body-linear-combo` median to `11.258000 s`
  (`1.6477x` vs main) in
  `/work/phy-weigw/hyx/xxx-b/test/codex_mu_indexed_basic_l2k2_speed_40_20260617`;
  it remains off and is not promoted.

Server checks:

- MPI `mlp-sus2` build in the independent work directory.
- `body-order < k-max+1` fails.
- Explicit `--two-layer-gate-body-order` fails.
- `k-max=4, body-order=6` gate scalars contain only body orders `2,3,4,5`.
- Single nonzero gate weights in body-order buckets `2,3,4,5` affect only their
  matching k channels.
- Zero gate weights match ordinary SH `calc-efs` energy and force.
- Double-site gate zero weights also match ordinary SH `calc-efs`, and nonzero
  double-site gate weights pass the loss-gradient check.
- CPU LAMMPS neighbor-site and double-site gate models match `mlp-sus2
  calc-efs` on the additive shared-radial smoke case. The 1-rank and 2-rank
  LAMMPS runs are bitwise identical in the checked energy/force values.
- Smoke run in `/work/phy-weigw/hyx/5.28-mof-cl-h2o/new-gate/` with the new
  independent binary.

The earlier 40-rank product-array result above is historical. Current LAMMPS
speed conclusions for this branch should use a single `1t88c` allocation with
96 ranks and `span[ptile=96]`.

| l4k4 | `mu-scalar-full` | `10.618700 s` | `13.354700 s` | `1.2577x` |

Decision:

- `mu-body-linear-combo` is within the `1.20x` target for all tested q-total
  models with `l<=4, k<=4`.
- `mu-scalar-full` is within target for l2k2, l2k3, l2k4, l3k3, and l4k3, but
  remains above target for l3k4 and l4k4. The current worst valid 1t88c result
  is l4k4 `mu-scalar-full` at `1.2577x`.
- Therefore the branch has not globally reached the `1.20x` target for both
  gate weight modes. Earlier "l4k4 within 1.2x" notes should be treated as
  combo-mode, 40-rank, candidate-specific, or invalid-baseline evidence unless
  the exact binary family, ISA, queue, rank layout, model, and gate mode match.

Rejected exact candidates from the 2026-06-18 1t88c round:

- `lmp.ml-sus2_mu_body_gate_spr_low.stride20_groupadj_noipo_trial`
  (build job 3806948, binary SHA-256
  `0f2cfeb611ebd360687d334c87e3b78e2c81798306ab9a655a91301ac51a934b`) was
  slower than guarded_envbatch in direct A/B testing:
  `/work/phy-weigw/hyx/xxx-b/test/codex_stride20_vs_guarded_spr_ab_96_20260618_052029/stride20_vs_guarded_spr_ab_summary.txt`.
  It also introduced a max force difference of about `6.9e-15` in AVX2 run-0
  parity, so it is not promoted.
- Runtime `SUS2_LAMMPS_GATE_COMPACT_MOMENT_CACHE=1` slowed both l3k4 and l4k4
  `mu-scalar-full`.
- Runtime `SUS2_LAMMPS_GATE_REQUIRED_BASIC=1` plus
  `SUS2_LAMMPS_GATE_REQUIRED_DOT=1` was mixed: l3k4 `mu-scalar-full` improved
  slightly, but l4k4 slowed. Keep the default heuristics.
