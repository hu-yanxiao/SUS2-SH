# SUS2-SH

SUS2-SH is the spherical-harmonic development branch of SUS2-MLIP. It keeps the
original SUS2 C++ training flow, file conventions, BFGS optimizer, E/F/S
equation assembly, and model save/load path, while replacing the angular moment
tensor basis with real spherical harmonic channels:

```text
B[k,l,m] = sum_j R_{k,l}(r_ij) Y_lm_real(rhat_ij)
```

The model generator writes the complete tensor-product graph and real-basis
Clebsch-Gordan contraction coefficients into the `.mtp` file. Training can still
use the minimal scalar multiplication graph, while downstream engines such as
GPUMD can use the stored product graph for matrix-oriented execution.

This repository is currently a developer project derived from SUS2-MLIP v1.1.
For implementation notes, scalar enumeration rules, validation status, and the
current GPUMD export plan, see `docs/sus2-sh-development.md`.

The inherited SUS2-MLIP documentation below remains relevant for CFG/MTP formats
and ordinary `mlp-sus2` usage.

# Installation
You can build the training executable by running:
```bash
 ./configure
 make mlp  ## get bin/mlp-sus2
 make libinterface ## get lib/libinterface.a for external tool e.g. PySUS2 (in progress)
```

Initialize a SUS2-SH model, for example:

```bash
bin/mlp-sus2 init-sh untrained_sus2sh_l3k3_b5_l3322.mtp \
  --species-count=2 \
  --l-max=3 \
  --k-max=3 \
  --body-order=5 \
  --body-l-max=3,3,2,2 \
  --cutoff=7.5 \
  --radial-basis-size=10 \
  --radial-basis-type=RBChebyshev_sss
```

For 6body models, pass five body-specific l cutoffs. The current 6body
generator uses the rank-diagonal standard-tree rule:

```bash
bin/mlp-sus2 init-sh untrained_sus2sh_l3k3_b6_l33222.mtp \
  --species-count=2 \
  --l-max=3 \
  --k-max=3 \
  --body-order=6 \
  --body-l-max=3,3,2,2,2 \
  --cutoff=7.5 \
  --radial-basis-size=10 \
  --radial-basis-type=RBChebyshev_sss
```

Then train through the normal SUS2 path:

```bash
bin/mlp-sus2 train untrained_sus2sh_l3k3_b5_l3322.mtp train.cfg \
  --energy-weight=1 \
  --force-weight=0.01 \
  --stress-weight=0 \
  --do-samp \
  --do-lin \
  --do-lin-rescale \
  --curr-pot-name=current.mtp \
  --trained-pot-name=p.mtp
```
# Format of Datasets
Like the original MLIP package, SUS2-MLIP reads material structures and their properties from `cfg` files.

Format of `cfg` file:

# Untrained Models
**:red_circle: PLEASE NOTE :red_circle:**: While the implementation of SUS2-MLIP is built upon the MLIP package, there are notable and fundamental differences between them. As a result, the  models in the `untrained_mtps/` folder cannot be used within our current framework.

Format of `.mtp` files for SUS2-MLIP:
```bash
MTP
version = 1.1.0
potential_name = sus2mlip_l2k2
scaling = 0.01
L = 2
scaling_map = LK
species_count = 2
potential_tag =
        min_dist = 1.5
        max_dist = 6.0
        ...
```
There are two new hyperparameters `L` and `scaling_map`.
`L` reffers to the max level of moment tensor.  (**DON'T CHANGE**)
`scaling_map = L` or `K` or `LK` corresponds to 𝜂=(𝐿,𝐾), 𝜂=𝐿 and 𝜂=𝐾 respectively. η determines the dimensions on which the global scaling are applied:
 $$r_{Ij,{\color{red}\eta}}^{*}=\alpha_{Z_{I}Z_{j},{\color{red}\eta}}\left(r_{Ij}-r_{0}^{Z_{I}Z_{j},{\color{red}\eta}}\right)$$

**Note**: `min_dist` in our model do not affect the mapping from pair distance *r* to *x∈[-1,1]* due to the nonlinearity-embedded universal radial fuction, but it determines the inintialization of scaling factor. Setting `min_dist = 0.0` is usually a good choice.



At `untrained_sus2mlip/`, we prepared 6 sets of untrained basis corresponding to `L∈{2,3} & k∈{1,3}`. In both model, the interactions are considered up to the 5-body. Further details regarding the scalar basis in each model are provided in the table below.

More technical details about unvirsal scaling and super-linear radial function can be found in our paper:

# Usage
SUS2-MLIP models are trained and evaluated using `mlp-sus2` command, similar to `mlp` of MLIP. See the [user manual of MLIP](https://gitlab.com/ashapeev/mlip-2/-/blob/master/doc/manual/manual.pdf?ref_type=heads) for details. **The following are some frequently used commands:**
* **Basic model training**
To train a model, you should run `mlp-sus2 train` with prepared dataset `trainset.cfg`, untrained model `untrained_sus2mlip` and training options:
```bash
mlp-sus2 train untrained_sus2mlip trainset.cfg --curr-pot-name=current.mtp
```
Commonly used training tags:

```bash
--energy-weight=<double>
--force-weight=<double>
--stress-weight=<double>
--distribution-weight=<double>
--std-weight=<double>
--stdd-weight=<double>
--valid-cfgs=<string>
--max-iter=<int>
--curr-pot-name=<string>
--trained-pot-name=<string>
--bfgs-conv-tol=<double>
--weighting=<string>
--init-params=<random|same>
--do-lin
--do-lin-rescale
--do-lin-steps=<int>
--do-lin-freq=<int>
--do-samp=<true|false>
--skip-preinit
--update-mindist
```

Notes:

- `--do-lin` enables the linear pre-fitting path inside nonlinear training.
- `--do-lin-rescale` runs the existing subset-based rescale pass before each full-data `TrainLinear` call inserted by BFGS `do-lin`.
- `--do-lin-steps` sets how many accepted BFGS steps keep the do-lin path active. Default is `1000`.
- `--do-lin-freq` sets how often `TrainLinear` is inserted while do-lin is active. Default is `50`.
- `--do-samp=false` disables random sampling during the pre-training stage.
- `--std-weight` and `--stdd-weight` control the two std-based regularization terms.
* **Evaluating trained models**
To evaluate a tarined model `trained_sus2mlip` on a specified dataset `target.cfg`, you run:
```bash
mlp-sus2 calc-errors trained_sus2mlip target.cfg
```
# External Tools
## LAMMPS
The maintained LAMMPS interface is provided in `interfaces/lammps/` and as the
historical `sus2-interface-20260410.tar.gz` archive included in this snapshot.
The interface package name is `ML-SUS2`, and the LAMMPS runtime syntax remains
`pair_style sus2mtp` / `pair_style sus2mtp/kk`.

Quick install into a clean LAMMPS tree:

```bash
cd interfaces/lammps
scripts/install_into_lammps.sh /path/to/lammps
```

The interface package contains the CPU source layer, the Kokkos/GPU override
layer, and the Intel CPU make targets used by the maintained server build. See
`interfaces/lammps/README.md` for the full CPU/GPU build workflow.

**Note**: Setting `radial_basis_type = RBChebyshev_sss_lmp`,
`RBLaguerre_log1p_lmp`, `RBLaguerre_log1p_pos_lmp`, or `RBJacobi_sss_lmp`
enables the list-based treatment of radial functions in the LAMMPS interface.
The optional `tabstep` keyword controls the table spacing, with a default of
`1.0e-4` Angstrom. The preinterpolation table is built only for species pairs
that actually appear in the current simulation atom types.
## GPUMD-SUS2
The maintained GPUMD interface is hosted separately at
[GPUMD-SUS2](https://github.com/hu-yanxiao/GPUMD-SUS2). It provides SUS2 v1.1
GPU inference support for GPUMD, including the current table path, optional
direct radial evaluation, product-assign optimization, and model-topology
code-generation utilities. Use the GPUMD-SUS2 repository for GPUMD builds; this
SUS2-MLIP repository remains the training/model-core source.
## PySUS2
PySUS2 is a comprehensive suite of tools and Python modules developed based on the SUS2-MLIP model, designed for atomistic simulations. It supports a range of functionalities including structure relaxation, phonon dispersion analysis, and lattice thermal conductivity calculations.
(in progress)
## CSO-AES
[CSO-AES](https://github.com/hu-yanxiao/CSO-AES/tree/main) (Covering Set Optimization driven Atomic Environment Sampling) is a Python tool designed to facilitate active learning in SUS2-MLIP modeling. It also helps with the integration and optimization of the database, making it easier for researchers and developers to work with.
(in progress)
